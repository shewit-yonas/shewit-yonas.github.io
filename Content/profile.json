    "AboutText": "Hi, I’m Shewit Yonas, a Mechanical Engineering student at Seattle Pacific University with a strong passion for engineering design, problem-solving, and hands-on technical work. I am particularly interested in CAD design, mechanical systems, and engineering analysis, and I enjoy applying engineering principles to real-world challenges.<br><br>With experience working as an engineering intern, an academic tutor, and a student project designer, I have developed a strong foundation in communication, teamwork, and technical design. I thrive in collaborative project environments where I can contribute practical solutions, learn advanced tools, and grow both technically and professionally.<br><br>Outside of academics, I enjoy working on multidisciplinary engineering projects, from prototyping mechanical systems to developing performance models in MATLAB. I am committed to continuous learning, expanding my skillset, and pursuing opportunities that integrate mechanical design, sustainability, and innovation."
